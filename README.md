# Module 18 Challenge

- Project Titile:
  - Social Network API

- Description:
  - I was tasked with building an API for a social network web app that allows users to share thoughts, react, and create friends lists. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In the walkthrough video you will see how this API works!
